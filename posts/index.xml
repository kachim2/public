      <description>The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity is a very well known charity in Poland. It helps hospitals and patients by funding medical equipment. However they don&amp;rsquo;t do it like most other charities by asking for money on every ocasion. They make helping sick people accually fun. Once a year, they organize what they call a &amp;ldquo;GRAND FINALE&amp;rdquo;. During it they organise Concerts and other event&amp;rsquo;s. They make soup and flatbread for everyone that donates.</description>
