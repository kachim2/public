However they don&rsquo;t do it like most other charities by asking for money on every ocasion. They make helping sick people accually fun. Once a year, they organize what they call a <em><strong>&ldquo;GRAND FINALE&rdquo;</strong></em>. During it they organise Concerts and other event&rsquo;s. They make soup and flatbread for everyone that donates. They show of vintage cars, they dance, they let you print out hearts on a 3D printer, they bring dogs, retired solidiers tell wartime stories, you can play VR, or get into a basket lift, even the fire brigade shows up. The concerts aren&rsquo;t just any concerts where no one know the people playing, thay feature Poland&rsquo;s most famous singers, for example <em>Maryla Rodowicz</em> and <em>Marek Dyjak</em>. So over all, if you want to help, and get some fun in return go to the <em><strong>&ldquo;GRAND FINALE&rdquo;</strong></em> from The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity.</p>
